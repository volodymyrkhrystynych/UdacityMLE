Use the space below to show that you can use [fbeta in sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.fbeta_score.html) to replicate your f1-score from above.  If in the future you want to use a different weighting, [this article](http://mlwiki.org/index.php/Precision_and_Recall) does an amazing job of explaining how you might adjust beta for different situations."
